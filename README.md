# attempting_kaggle_2025_santa_competition
attempt at trying to get into the leaderboard of kaggle 2025 santa competition




### Update as of Jan 2, 2025 Fri. Packing score generated for not just ordinary rectangles but rotated rectangles. the plan is to first 'pack' a 'convex shape' of a rectangle into the santa christmas box before delving into packing the 'concave christmas tree shape'. Though to be honest time is running away.. :(
